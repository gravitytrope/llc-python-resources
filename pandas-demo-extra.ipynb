    "When you were viewing the `'llc-workshop-data.csv'` file, you may have noticed that most of the names in the \"Event Name\" column included the name of the city, in a variety of different formats (e.g. \"in Toronto\", \"(Toronto Edition)\", \"(Toronto)\", \" - Toronto\"). This situation is typical in real world data&mdash;it's often messy and inconsistent, with two or more useful pieces of information smushed into one and no obvious way to extract those parts out of the whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would be great to know the city associated with each event and analyze our data on a city-by-city basis. Ideally, we might have a separate file which lists additional information for each event, including the city name. In that case, we could use `pandas` to easily merge that data with the data we've been working with. However, we often don't have all the extra data we might want, so in that situation it would be nice to somehow extract the city names from the event names. But how would we even do this in a spreadsheet? It is possible, but it would be quite excruciating.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, however, this sort of task is much, much easier. It requires knowledge of some fairly advanced concepts, but after you've learned those concepts it's pretty straightforward to apply them to a situation like this one. In the code below, I'm using \"regular expressions\" from a library called `re` to look for text patterns that allow me to find and extract the city names. If you'd like to learn more about regular expressions, you can check out [this tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/regular-expressions-data-scientists/) and this [handy cheatsheet](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/regex-cheatsheet/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below may look overwhelming, but as before, don't worry about trying to understand the details of it&mdash;this type of text wrangling is a pretty specialized niche of the data analysis ecosystem and may not be relevant to your work (but for any of you who do need to parse information from text data, it's nice to know that this sort of thing can be done in Python). The code is taking all the event names in our data, looking for the various patterns associated with the city names (\"in Toronto\", \"(Toronto)\", etc.) and then putting the city name and a standardized version of the event name (minus the city) into two new columns of our data table."

    "Now we have a column of city names, and with the code below we can easily check that the city names make sense, and see the number of participants for each city. When I was writing the `parse_event_name` function above, I started with just one pattern to look for the city name, and then used the code below to see what other patterns were in the data, and update my `parse_event_name` function with those patterns, building up my code with an **iterative** approach. `pandas` makes it easy to build up your code in this way, checking for each inconsistency or messiness in your data, and adding a few lines of code to account for it and standardize the data into a consistent format."
