    "## Python for data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "I always say Python is like a <i>\"choose your own adventure\"</i> because there are many different ways of installing it, setting up your environment for coding (e.g. PyCharm vs. Jupyter notebooks), and when you're writing code there are usually many different ways to accomplish a task. This makes it very flexible and easy to do things exactly the way you want, but it can also be overwhelming when you're just starting out and don't know where to go next!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I'm going to recommend some options based on what has worked well for me for data analysis, but this certainly isn't the only way to do things. You may find as you explore and try things out, that something else works better for you, so don't feel obligated to do everything the way I've suggested here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the workshop, Python comes with many handy built-in functions, like `print()`, `type()`, and `int()`. It also comes with some handy <b>built-in libraries</b> that we can use --- <i>in your workshop slides, see the ones titled \"Using a Library\"</i>. A library (also called a \"package\") is a collection of Python code that is grouped together and given a name (e.g. `csv`) and after we import a library (e.g. `import csv`) we can then use all the pieces of code that are inside of it, like functions (e.g. `csv.DictReader()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you're doing some serious data crunching, you're going to want to use some additional libraries that don't automatically come with the Python that was already on your computer (if you're on a Mac) or which you downloaded from https://www.python.org/ (if you're on Windows). These are called <b>3rd party libraries</b>, and they're free and available for anyone to use --- you just need to install them in a way such that Python can find them. This can be a bit tricky, and there are a few different ways of doing it. Here I will be showing one approach, which I think is the easiest one for folks who want to use Python for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "For anyone who wants to use Python for data analysis, I recommend installing a program called <b>Anaconda</b>. This is a \"Python distribution\", which means it includes the <b>standard Python</b> that we worked with today, <b>plus some extra stuff</b>: \n",
    "* all the most common 3rd party libraries for data analysis are pre-installed so you don't have to install them all yourself, and \n",
    "* it includes a package manager that you can use if you need to install any additional libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download Anaconda here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/. You'll need to select either Python 3.6 or Python 2.7 - here's the first choice in the choose your own adventure! Either one is fine. I recommend Python 3.6 unless you already know that you need Python 2 for some reason. You can always install another Python version later if you need it, and multiple versions can co-exist peacefully without interfering with each other.\n",
    "* Installation instructions for Windows: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows\n",
    "* Installation instructions for Mac: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need about <b>2.5 GB of free disk space</b> to install Anaconda. If disk space is an issue, there is another option here: https://conda.io/miniconda.html. This is a bare bones installation requiring very little disk space, but it is a bit more complicated because you would then need to install whatever libraries you need yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Anaconda with PyCharm\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've installed Anaconda, you can set up PyCharm so that it will use your Anaconda version of Python instead of the default Python that it was using before. To do this, you need to change the project interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show screenshots here.\n",
    "\n",
    "For changes to take effect, you'll need to exit PyCharm and restart it.\n",
